##1. Problem: The Fibonacci palindrome problem
A contiguous sequence of unsigned integers is considered a "Fibonacci palindrome" if two conditions hold:

    1. the sequence is the same whether read backward or forward.

    2. either the sequence has fewer than three elements, or every contiguous three-element sequence {a, b, c} in it satisfies at least one of these conditions: a==c, a+b==c, or a==b+c.
## 2. How to use it
### 2.1 run main class 
    1. main class file: com.example.HomeWorkMain.java<br>
    
    2. input: list format like '1,2,3,4'
